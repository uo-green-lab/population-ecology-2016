###Course Philosophy and Goals
This course should provide a novel, and hopefully fun, way of learning about population ecology. We will learn about population ecology through a combination of reading, problem solving, computational exercises, writing and discussion.  My goal is that by the end of the course, all students will be able to 1) use relatively simple mathematical methods (often “back of the envelope” variety) to understand ecological systems, and 2) digest and articulate the salient points on current topics relevant to population ecology.  Equipped with these skills, students will be adept at making informed decisions relevant to science-driven policy and innovation. Our approach throughout the course will be to teach, rather than lecture.  Thus, students will be expected to participate in the learning process during class sessions, to develop code and reproducible analyses, and to team-teach one lecture. Adjustments will be made to the following outline based on the needs of the class as we progress.
 
###Readings
There is no comprehensive textbook that covers the breadth of topics we will explore. We will draw upon the textbook below during the first half of the term and it is [available for purchase at Amazon.com.](http://www.amazon.com/Population-Biology-Concepts-Alan-Hastings/dp/0387948538/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1459462152&sr=8-1&keywords=hastings+population+ecology)
 
Hastings, A.  *Population Biology: concepts and models.*  1997.  Springer-Verlag, New York.
 
Additional required readings will be available [here.](./additional-readings/)
 
###Homework
Approximately 8 assignments will be due in this course (problem sets and team teaching materials).  Assignments will be due about one week after the relevant course material has been covered. Assignments are due Thursday (midnight) the day before class.  Late homework will not be accepted.  Students are strongly encouraged to collaborate on assignments outside of class. Homeworks will be posted [here.](./homework/) Homework will be graded on a three tier system:  complete, partial, incomplete.  Homework solutions will be reviewed in class.  
 
###Exams
There will be two exams (Week 4 and Week 8) to be completed in class.
 
###Wiki-a-thon & team teaching
All students will be required to participate in a wiki-a-thon and to team-teach one topic.  The wiki-a-thon will include creating new wiki entries, sprucing up old ones, with a focus on population ecology.  Team teaching will center on wiki-topics.  It will include choosing relevant class reading or media on the topic & leading a class discussion.  Approximately five weeks prior to the day your team is scheduled to lead a topic you will submit a proposal for: 1) the topic, 2) reading and/or media, and 3) a strategic planning outline.  Details on the wiki-a-thon and team teaching will be posted on the github site.
  
###Grade Determination
Your final grade will be based on *1/4* homework (problem sets), *1/4* wiki-a-thon and team teaching (proposal & execution), *1/4* Week 4 exam, *1/4* Week 8 exam.
 
###Cell Phones
All portable electronic devices (e.g. cell phones) must be turned off and put away during class.
 
###Academic Conduct
Academic integrity is the foundation of an academic community and without it none of the educational or research goals of the university can be achieved.  All members of the university community are responsible for its academic integrity. Existing policies forbid cheating on examinations, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty.  Please refamiliarize yourself with the definitions of cheating and plagarism (see the “about cheating” sections at http://studentlife.uoregon.edu/programs/student_judi_affairs).  If you have doubts or questions about acceptable conduct in any situation, I encourage you to discuss the situation with me in advance.  University rules on academic integrity will be strictly enforced.

### Appendix
Team Teaching.  Your team teaching project will comprise four steps as described below.
 
**1)** Choose a topic area
Projects can focus on any current topic relevant to population ecology.  Example topic areas include:
 
### Pandemics
- http://www.gvfi.org/
- http://www.gatesfoundation.org
- http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/larry_brilliant_wants_to_stop_pandemics.html

### Invasive species
- http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/homogecene/
- http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/invasive_species/index.html
 
### Any species you are interested in with global relevance
- Fish? http://www.ted.com/talks/tierney_thys_swims_with_the_giant_sunfish.html
- Chimpanzee? http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jane_goodall_at_tedglobal_07.html
- Bird? http://www.ted.com/talks/juliana_machado_ferreira.html
- Mushroom? http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/research/07brfs-MAGICMUSHROO_BRF.html
 
**2)** Choose class readings/videos
Readings/videos must be chosen very carefully with the following goals:  1) concise, 2) published in a reputable venue within the past 24 months, 4) relevant to the main points you want to convey in class.  At least one reading must be assigned, and no more than 2 readings/videos total may be assigned.
 
**3)** Make a class discussion outline
Your outline should be no more than 2 pages include the following information:
 
- What are the 3 main messages you want the class to know?
- How will you convey these messages during the first ~15 minutes of class?
- What activities do you have planned for the next ~15 minutes of class to convey these messages?
- How do you intend to wrap up and review the take home messages?
 
Creativity in how classes are run is welcome.  Students may choose to present information using the chalkboard, video, in-class interviews, games, comics, or any other compelling means.  All materials must be student created.  Video cameras will be available to check out from Professor Green.
 
**4)** Lead class discussion!
 
### Grading
